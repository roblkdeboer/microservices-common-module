# Background

This is a common module used as a part of a microservices ticketing app. The purpose of this package is to upload it to NPM so that it can be used as common, shared code across multiple microservices.

# Deployment

`npm run pub`

This command will commit any uncommitted code, increment the NPM patch version number by 1 and publish it to NPM as an update to the package.

This is purely for testing purposes.
